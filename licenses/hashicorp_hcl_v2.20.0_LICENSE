You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form","     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how","     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or","     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.","","3.2. Distribution of Executable Form","","     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:","","     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,","        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the","        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by","        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost","        of distribution to the recipient; and","","     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,","        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for","        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’","        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.","","3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work","","     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,","     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the","     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software","     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered","     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits","     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of","     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at","     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of","     either this License or such Secondary License(s).","","3.4. Notices","","     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including","     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations","     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered","     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent","     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.","","3.5. Application of Additional Terms","","     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,","     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered","     Software.

Termination","","5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You","     fail to comply with any of its terms.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent","     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,","     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or","     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and","     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License","     shall terminate.","","5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user","     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been","     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to","     termination shall survive termination.","","6.

Limitation of Liability","","   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including","   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who","   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any","   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any","   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of","   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all","   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been","   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability","   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such","   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.","   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or","   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.","","8. Litigation","","   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of","   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business","   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without","   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall","   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.","","9. Miscellaneous","","   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter","   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such","   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it","   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a","   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe","   this License against a Contributor.","","","10.
